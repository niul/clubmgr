# About
sponsors.title=Sponsors
sponsors.section.image.alt=R&B Brewing Logo
sponsors.section.main.header=R&B Brewing
sponsors.section.main.p1=R&B have been brewing finely made, hand crafted ales and lagers in the heart of East Vancouver\u2019s historic Brewery Creek district for over a decade, with a commitment to keeping things modest, independent, and unique. R&B Brewing Co. has always been, and will always be, just about as independent of a microbrewery as you\u2019ll come across. Founded in 1997 by longtime friends and co-workers Rick Dellow and Barry Benson (the \u2018R\u2019 & \u2018B\u2019, respectively), R&B Brewing Co. was set up to stand in opposition to what the beer world had become \u2013 big, non-descript, faceless, and corporate.
